# A-Simple-Todo-List
This is the simple todo-list as you can say this an assignment or a mini-project. Kind of basic and a beginner-friendly assignment so I've created a todo-list where you can add some of the items by clicking "submit" button and you can remove it by clicking on "clear" button. This is nothing but a short assignment pulled by me. Hopefully I'll enhance by skill hereafter and create more projects.

Features:-
Add the items, Clear the item, Item Count
